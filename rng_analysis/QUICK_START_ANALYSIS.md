# Quick Start: RNG Analysis

Get started analyzing the DuckDice RNG in 5 minutes!

## 1. Install Dependencies (2 minutes)

```bash
cd rng_analysis
pip install -r requirements_analysis.txt
```

## 2. Verify Your Data (30 seconds)

Make sure you have CSV files in `bet_history/`:

```bash
# Windows
dir ..\bet_history\*.csv

# Linux/Mac
ls -la ../bet_history/*.csv
```

**Files should contain columns:** Date, Nonce, Number, Result, Verification link

## 3. Run Analysis (2 minutes)

### Option A: Full Analysis (Recommended)

```bash
python main_analysis.py
```

This runs everything:
- ‚úÖ Statistical tests
- ‚úÖ Machine learning models
- ‚úÖ Deep learning (LSTM, GRU, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Visualizations

**Time:** ~5-10 minutes depending on data size

### Option B: Quick Analysis (Fast)

```bash
python main_analysis.py --skip-dl --skip-viz
```

This skips deep learning and visualizations.

**Time:** ~2-3 minutes

### Option C: Statistical Only (Fastest)

```bash
python pattern_analyzer.py
```

**Time:** ~30 seconds

## 4. Check Results

### Console Output

Look for these key sections:

**‚úÖ PASS Results (Expected for secure RNG):**
```
Distribution Test: PASS ‚úÖ
Autocorrelation: PASS ‚úÖ
Runs Test: PASS ‚úÖ
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Model Performance:**
```
Best ML Model: XGBoost
Improvement: 2.5% (expected: <5%)
```

**üìä Conclusion:**
```
‚úÖ Models show minimal improvement
   The RNG appears cryptographically sound
```

### Visualizations

If generated (not skipped), check `visualizations/` folder:
- `distribution.png` - Should look uniform
- `autocorrelation.png` - Should be near zero
- `time_series.png` - Should look random
- `pattern_heatmap.png` - Should be uniform

## 5. Interpret Results

### What Good Results Look Like (Secure RNG)

‚úÖ **Statistical Tests:**
- Distribution: PASS
- Autocorrelation: No significant correlations
- Runs Test: PASS

‚úÖ **Machine Learning:**
- Improvement: < 5%
- R¬≤: Close to 0
- MAE: ~2887 (baseline)

‚úÖ **Deep Learning:**
- Cannot beat baseline
- Similar train/val loss
- No predictive power

### What Bad Results Look Like

‚ö†Ô∏è **But still NOT exploitable!**

Even if you see:
- Some test failures
- ML improvement > 10%
- Low R¬≤ but some correlation

This does NOT mean:
- ‚ùå You can predict future bets
- ‚ùå The RNG is broken
- ‚ùå You should bet based on predictions

It likely means:
- Overfitting to training data
- Random noise interpreted as patterns
- Temporal artifacts (time of day)
- None of these generalize!

## Common Questions

### Q: My model shows 15% improvement! Can I win?

**A: No.** This is overfitting. Performance on training data ‚â† real predictive power.

### Q: I see patterns in the visualization!

**A: Normal.** Humans see patterns in randomness. These are statistical fluctuations.

### Q: Should I bet more after seeing these results?

**A: NEVER.** This analysis is educational. Do not use it for actual betting.

### Q: How do I verify DuckDice isn't cheating?

**A:** Use the verification links in your bet history:
```
https://codepen.io/DuckDice/pen/abdNzQE?serverSeed=xxx&clientSeed=yyy&nonce=nnn
```

This lets you cryptographically verify each bet was fair.

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "No CSV files found"

```bash
# Check your path
python main_analysis.py --data-dir ../bet_history
```

### Error: "ModuleNotFoundError"

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements_analysis.txt
```

### Out of Memory Error

```bash
# Skip deep learning (memory intensive)
python main_analysis.py --skip-dl
```

### Too Slow

```bash
# Reduce epochs
python main_analysis.py --dl-epochs 10

# Or skip DL entirely
python main_analysis.py --skip-dl
```

## Next Steps

1. **Read the full README.md** for detailed explanations
2. **Check visualizations** to understand patterns
3. **Experiment** with different parameters
4. **Learn** about cryptographic RNG
5. **DON'T** use results for actual betting!

## Output Example

```
====================================================================
                 COMPREHENSIVE RNG ANALYSIS REPORT
====================================================================

DATASET OVERVIEW:
  Total Bets: 10,000
  Win Rate: 12.05%
  Number Range: 0 - 9999
  Mean: 5001.23 (Expected: 5000)

STATISTICAL TESTS:
  Distribution Test: PASS ‚úÖ
  KS p-value: 0.234567
  Autocorrelation: PASS ‚úÖ
  Runs Test: PASS ‚úÖ

MACHINE LEARNING RESULTS:
  Best Model: XGBoost
  Improvement: 3.45%
  MAE: 2845.67

DEEP LEARNING RESULTS:
  Best Model: LSTM
  Improvement: 2.89%
  MAE: 2867.23

====================================================================
FINAL CONCLUSIONS:
====================================================================

‚úÖ Models show minimal improvement (<5%)

This is the expected result for a secure RNG:
  - No exploitable patterns detected
  - Historical data provides no predictive power
  - The RNG appears cryptographically sound

====================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS:
====================================================================

1. DO NOT attempt to exploit perceived patterns
   ‚Üí They will not persist in real betting

2. DO verify your bets using verification links
   ‚Üí This ensures the casino isn't cheating

3. DO gamble responsibly
   ‚Üí Only bet what you can afford to lose

====================================================================
```

## Remember

üé≤ **The house always wins in the long run**

Even if you find "patterns":
- They won't work in practice
- Cryptographic RNG is secure
- House edge guarantees casino profit
- Gamble for entertainment, not profit

**Educational purposes only. Gamble responsibly!**
